# </> Manufac Analytics - Indian Agriculture Data Analytics
This project performs analytics on the Indian Agriculture dataset provided by the National Data and Analytics Platform, NITI Aayog. The goal is to analyze agricultural data from the years 1950 to 2020, aggregate it, and display the results in two tables. The project is built using **TypeScript** and **Vite**, with **Mantine v7** used for displaying tables in the frontend.

The main tasks involve calculating specific agricultural statistics and displaying them in a structured format within the browser when the development server is run.


## üìå Features
- **Data Analysis:** Aggregation of crops data to find the crop with the **maximum production** and the crop with the **minimum production** for each year (1950-2020). Aggregation of crop data to compute the **average yield** and the **average cultivation area** of each crop between 1950-2020.

- **Data Presentation:** The results are displayed as two tables using **Mantine v7** components. All missing data points in the dataset are treated as 0.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
   - **React**: The core JavaScript library used for building the user interface, providing a component-based architecture and efficient re-rendering.
   - **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
   - **Vite**: A fast development environment with TypeScript pre-configured.
   - **Mantine v7**: A React component library used for building the tables in the frontend.
   - **react-icons**: Used for adding customizable icons to the tables and UI elements.
   - **No external libraries** like Bootstrap, jQuery, or Lodash are used.
